# **Geo-Web Application on Finding the Nearest Parking Space (ParkEasy)**

## **By Ruth Ekeh and Chimezie Azih (ENGO 651 Group 5)**

In this project, we create a web application that addresses the critical issue of parking management in urban areas by allowing users to find the nearest on-street parking based on their live position and the API dataset on parking from Calgary's open data platform. To build this application, we deploy python's Django framework for the backend and React for the frontend. The app works with the MVT architecture for its backend and a modular design pattern for its frontend. By utilizing the user’s real-time location data, the application hopes to help reduce traffic congestion, parking search time, and associated environmental pollution. The user-friendly interface enables drivers to access real-time parking location information and make informed decisions while searching for parking zones. The web application is built with a simple interface to allow for easy use. We have used technologies and tools like the React framework, Django framework, as well as SQLite to create and manage the functionalities in the app. The primary data used for the app’s core functionality is sourced from Calgary’s Open Data API on on-street parking. Using the Haversine formular, the nearest parking lots to users are calculated and a suggestion based on this is made to the user.

## **The Tools Used**
For this project, we used Django framework for the backend and React (html, SCSS, javascript) for the frontend. The core API resources used for this project are the Calgary Open dataset API on on-street parking and the mapping API from Mapbox. You can find the full documentation of the On-street parkinh API [here](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.calgary.ca/rhkg-vwwp).
